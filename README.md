# Reduced-Dimension Neutron Transport Code for Investigating Neutron Moderation in Inertial Confinement Fusion Nucleosynthesis Experiments


## Documents
 - [Thesis](docs/thesis.pdf)
 - [Presentation given at viva](docs/viva_presentation.pdf)

## Description
- Neutron transport code written for Masters project at Imperial College London
- Solves neutron transport code for a reduced-dimension represenation of an ICF capsule
- Neutron transport model is in source/
- "Experiments" that use the model to perform analyses into neutron moderation and target mixing are in experiments/
